# Instructions for you to implement this code

1. First you need to download the mnist package that can be found here: https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/blob/master/data/mnist.pkl.gz
2. Now you need to copy the path to that archive and then paste in the part of the mnist_loader.py that says: 'thepathgoeshere'
3. Then you just need to execute the testing_adadelta.py with the three files in the same directory :) . It's nice and easy.
